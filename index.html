            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>I am a third-year Computer Science student with a passion for artificial intelligence, machine
                    learning, data science, and game development. My academic and project experience center on exploring
                    the connections between computing and human well-being through intelligent, purposeful design.</p>
                <p>I have developed several projects that reflect my interests in AI and simulation, including a
                    Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling Algorithm Simulator, The Serenity Institute—a mental healthcare
                    facility simulation game—and multiple neural network models such as a Feedforward Neural Network and
                    a Convolutional Neural Network for plastic bottle classification and weight prediction. These
                    projects represent my growing expertise in applying computational intelligence to creative and
                    socially meaningful contexts.</p>
                <p>My long-term goal is to develop games that raise mental health awareness and to contribute to
                    computing research at the intersection of artificial intelligence, interactive systems, and mental
                    health. I am highly systematic, a critical thinker, and an aspiring computer scientist dedicated to
                    advancing
                    the role of technology in understanding and improving the human experience.</p>
